### About `@lanun`

`@lanun` is a personal toolkit and design system built for my own projects which includes React related, and shared utilities.
It’s opinionated, lightweight, and tailored to how I like to build things.

While it’s primarily made for personal use, it’s fully open-source, feel free to explore, use, or adapt anything that fits your needs.
